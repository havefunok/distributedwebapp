# distributedwebap
A high-level design document, on a system designed to handle device status updates and requests in a scalable, real-time manner using a microservices architecture. 
This system employs Kafka for messaging, MongoDB for data storage, Flask/FastAPI for the API gateway, and React for the frontend, with authentication handled via Okta. The architecture also incorporates WebSockets for real-time communication between the server and clients.

System Overview

Components:
* Frontend: React application
* API Gateway Interface (AGI): Flask/FastAPI
* Messaging System: Kafka
* Database: MongoDB
* Scheduler/Status Service: Python microservice
* Authentication: Okta

Key Features:

1. Real-time UI updates.
2. Scalable messaging via Kafka.
3. Efficient data storage and retrieval with MongoDB.
4. Secure authentication and authorization with Okta.

Detailed Component Design:

A) Frontend (React Application)

* Implements user interfaces for device status monitoring.
* Uses WebSockets (via Socket.IO-client) for real-time communication with the backend.
* Integrates with Okta for user authentication and authorization.

B) API Gateway Interface (AGI) (Flask/FastAPI)

* Handles HTTP requests from the frontend, including device status requests.
* Authenticates requests using Okta SDKs, ensuring secure access.
* Publishes messages to Kafka topics for backend processing.
* Listens for responses from Kafka topics to relay back to the frontend via WebSockets.

C) Kafka Cluster

* Facilitates decoupled, asynchronous communication between services.
* Utilizes topics for device status requests and updates.
* Employs partitioning and offset management for scalable message processing.

D) MongoDB Database

* Stores device status information and other relevant data.
* Provides efficient data access for the Scheduler/Status Service.

E) Scheduler/Status Service

* Subscribes to Kafka topics to process device status requests.
* Checks MongoDB for device status; if outdated, fetches new status.
* Publishes status updates back to Kafka for relay to the AGI and then to the frontend.

F) Authentication (Okta)

* Manages user authentication and role-based access control.
* Integrated with the React frontend and Flask/FastAPI backend.


End-to-End Flow


i.User Interaction: Users log in through the React frontend, authenticated via Okta.

ii. Request Handling: The frontend sends device status requests to the AGI, which authenticates the request and publishes it to a Kafka topic.

iii. Processing: The Scheduler/Status Service consumes the request, checks MongoDB for current status, and possibly fetches new status if needed.

iv. Response Handling: Updated status information is published to a Kafka response topic, consumed by the AGI, and then sent back to the frontend via WebSockets.

v. Real-time Update: The frontend updates the UI in real-time with the received device status information.



Additional Considerations


i. Scalability: The system is designed to scale horizontally, with Kafka and MongoDB supporting high volumes of data and requests. Load balancing can be applied to the AGI and Scheduler/Status Service for additional scalability.

ii. Security: Secure communications using HTTPS/WSS, and ensure secure configurations for Kafka and MongoDB. Use Okta for robust authentication and authorization.

iii. Reliability: Implement retry mechanisms, error handling, and logging throughout the system to ensure reliability and ease of debugging.

iv. Monitoring: Employ monitoring tools to track system performance, Kafka throughput, and database performance.


Conclusion
This high-level design document outlines a scalable, real-time system for managing and monitoring device statuses. By leveraging modern technologies and architectural patterns, the system is well-equipped to handle real-time data processing, secure user interactions, and scalable backend processing, providing a robust solution for device status management.
